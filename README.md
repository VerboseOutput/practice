# Coding Questions

- implement memmove
- implement memcopy
- give a string, hide each bit of each character as the last bit of each pixel
- flip the endianness of a 32 bit integer
- bit bash a UART connection over some GPIO pins
    - do it with and without a timer interrupt
- count the set bits of a 32 bit integer
- read a hardware register address
- create an api for a FIFO queue
- read/set field of a 32 bit register
- design a set of APIs for 3 MCUs producing data and 1 MCU processing it
    - is it different over a SPI bus rather than using shared memory?
- read a 64bit counter on a 32 bit system
- write a multiplier without multiplying
- flip a bit
- design an API for writing arbitrary length data to flash at arbitrary location
    - the flash can only be written to a page at a time
    - data can not be written across a page boundry
